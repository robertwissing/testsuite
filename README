A large testsuite of different simulations. Can generate both closed-packed lattice, poisson distributed or glass generated ICs. The glass generation occurs through an IC-generator that can produce glass for a wide-range of density profiles.

Before starting, you potentially need to change dir,gasolinerun,mpirun variables in runtest.sh to point towards your specific gasoline/changa build and if you are running serial mpi etc. :
default is:
dir=$current_dir/../../
gasolinerun=ChaNGa.smp
mpirun="$dir/charmrun.smp +p 63"

If you wanna use the glass relaxation (hacked version of gasoline) you need to go into icgenerator/mdl/mpi and make and icgenerator/gasoline/ and make mpi (for default)

Usage: ./runtest.sh [-i] [-a value1] ... [-h value8] <nameofsimulation> <Nsmooth> <Nres> <0: lattice | 1: rand | 2: glass>

Options:
  -a, -b, -c, ...    These options depend on the simulation. To see the specific options, enter the nameofsimulation without arguments.
  -i                 Interactive.

Arguments:
  nameofsimulation   Name of the simulation to be run (e.g., shocktube).
  Nsmooth            Smoothing length for the simulation.
  Nres               Resolution for the simulation.
  0 | 1 | 2          Initial conditions type:
                     0: lattice
                     1: random
                     2: glass
If glass data file exist for a specific Nsmooth it will skipp the glass generation and run the simulation. If you choose an nSmooth that does not have a glass datafile it will do the whole glass generation again.
